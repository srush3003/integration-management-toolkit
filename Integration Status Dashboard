## Template Structure

### Column Definitions

| Column | Values | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Integration Name | Service name | What integration this is |
| Status | Not Started / In Progress / Waiting on Client / Waiting on Provider / Blocked / Complete | Current state |
| Owner | Client / Us / Dev / Provider | Who's responsible |
| Blocker | Text description or "None" | What's preventing progress |
| Next Action | Specific action needed | What needs to happen next |
| Target Date | MM/DD/YYYY | When this should be complete |
| Actual Date | MM/DD/YYYY | When it was actually completed |
| Notes | Text | Additional context |

---

## Status Definitions

**Not Started** = Haven't begun setup yet (usually means it's scheduled for later)

**In Progress** = Actively being worked on (accounts created, configuring settings)

**Waiting on Client** = Need something from client before we can proceed
- Examples: DNS access, credentials, approval, decision

**Waiting on Provider** = Waiting on external service
- Examples: DNS propagation (48hrs), Google OAuth approval (1-3 days), domain verification

**Blocked** = Cannot proceed due to issue
- Examples: Account locked, service down, technical limitation discovered

**Complete** = Fully configured and tested in all environments
- Must be tested in dev, staging, and production before marking complete

## Example Dashboard

| Integration | Status | Owner | Blocker | Next Action | Target | Actual | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------|-------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Resend Email | Waiting on Provider | Client | DNS propagating | Wait 24 more hours | Jan 22 | - | Added DNS records Jan 20 |
| Google SSO | In Progress | Dev | None | Configure redirect URLs | Jan 21 | - | OAuth consent screen approved |
| Supabase DB | Complete | Dev | None | - | Jan 18 | Jan 18 | Schema reviewed with client |
| Stripe Payment | Not Started | Client | Account not created | Client to create Stripe account | Jan 25 | - | Will set up Week 3 |
| Push Notifications | In Progress | Us | None | Set up Firebase project | Jan 23 | - | Client provided bundle IDs |
| Linqly Deep Links | Waiting on Client | Client | App not published yet | Wait for App Store approval | Jan 30 | - | Can't test until app published |

## Color Coding (If Using Spreadsheet)

**Status Colors:**
- 🟢 Complete = Green
- 🟡 In Progress = Yellow  
- 🔴 Blocked = Red
- ⚪ Waiting on Provider = Light gray
- 🟠 Waiting on Client = Orange
- ⚫ Not Started = White/no color

**Owner Colors:**
- Client = Light blue
- Us = Light green
- Dev = Light yellow
- Provider = Light gray

This makes it easy to scan and see: "Oh, 3 items waiting on client, 1 blocked, 2 in progress"

## How to Handle Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Client slow to provide credentials

**Update dashboard:**
- Status: Waiting on Client
- Blocker: "Waiting for DNS access since Jan 15"
- Next Action: "Follow up with client"
- Add note: "Sent reminder Jan 17, Jan 19. If no response by Jan 22, will escalate."

**In your Monday update, highlight:**
"⚠️ Resend Email integration is blocked waiting for DNS access (requested Jan 15). Without this, we can't test email features scheduled for Week 3. Can you provide by Jan 22?"

### Scenario: Integration failed testing

**Update dashboard:**
- Status: Blocked
- Blocker: "OAuth returns 400 error in staging"
- Next Action: "Debug redirect URL configuration"
- Add note: "Works in dev, fails in staging. Checking environment credentials."

**Don't mark Complete until tested in all environments**

### Scenario: Integration taking longer than expected

**Update dashboard:**
- Keep status accurate (In Progress)
- Update Target Date to realistic date
- Add note explaining delay
- Blocker: "Google OAuth approval taking longer than expected (submitted Jan 15, usually 1-3 days)"

**In Monday update:**
"🟡 Google SSO delayed - OAuth approval taking longer than typical 1-3 days. Will follow up with Google. Backup plan: Launch with email login, add Google login in v1.1."

## Tips for Keeping This Updated

**Make it a Monday ritual:**
- Block 15 minutes every Monday morning
- Go through each integration
- Update status based on what happened last week
- Send client update immediately after

**Use it in daily standups:**
- "Let me check the integration dashboard..."
- Reference it when dev says "blocked"
- Update it live during standup

**Share it proactively:**
- Don't wait for client to ask "what's the status?"
- Send weekly without being asked
- Shows you're organized and on top of things

**Keep notes detailed:**
- Future you will thank present you
- "Waiting on client" is not helpful 3 weeks later
- "Waiting on client to provide DNS access - emailed Jan 15, followed up Jan 17" is helpful

---

## Success Metrics

**Dashboard is working if:**
- ✅ Client knows status without asking
- ✅ Dev knows what's blocking them
- ✅ You can answer "what's the status?" in 30 seconds
- ✅ No surprises on launch day (everything tracked)

**Dashboard needs improvement if:**
- ❌ Client constantly asking for updates (not checking dashboard)
- ❌ Statuses are outdated (not updating regularly)
- ❌ Too many items in "Blocked" with no action plan
- ❌ Completing items without testing in all environments
