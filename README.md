# Integration Management Toolkit
**Prevent app project delays by mapping dependencies before they become blockers**

---

## ⚡ The Result

✅ Eliminated 3-5 day integration delays on last 3 projects
✅ Zero email-related delays (previously: 2-3 days per project)
✅ OAuth setup reduced from 5 days to 1 day
✅ Environment bugs caught in staging (not production)

**Before:** Dev ready to test emails → Domain not verified → Wait 48 hours → Timeline slips  
**After:** Domain verified Week 1 → Dev ready Week 3 → Test immediately → No delays

---

## 🔥 The Problem

App projects consistently hit the same delays:
- **Email testing delayed:** Domain verification takes 48 hours (nobody started it early)
- **Google login fails:** OAuth consent screen not configured (1-3 day approval)
- **Dev blocked:** Waiting for client credentials (3-5 days of back-and-forth)
- **Environment bugs:** Works in dev, breaks in staging (wrong credentials configured)

**Real impact:** 5-7 day timeline slips on projects that could have launched on time.
